### Downloads

#### Stable builds

The latest stable releases of these modpacks can be found on our dedicated Modrinth pages.

### Reporting Issues

If you do not need tech support and would like to report an issue (bug, crash, etc.) or otherwise request a feature for any modpack, then we encourage you to open an issue on the
[project issue tracker](https://codeberg.org/Nostalgica-Reverie/Legacy-Modpack-Monorepository/issues).

### Hardware Compatibility
Our modpacks, due to utilizing the powerful [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) or even [Vulkan](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod) mod, is only compatible with specific graphics cards or other hardware variants.

All of our Sodium/Embeddium packs will work with any GPU that supports ***OpenGL 4.5 or newer.***
Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years will meet these requirements.

### Minimum Requirements (Sodium)

-  INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer
-  NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer
-  AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer

If you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. I also recommend taking a look at [this page](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) on the Sodium wiki.

For our Vulkan modpacks, they will support any GPU that supports Vulkan 1.2 or above.

### Minimum Requirements (Vulkan)

- Vulkan 1.2 capable discrete GPU (GTX 900+ / RX 400+ / Intel Arc A-series)
We recommend that you have at least a AMD RDNA or NVIDIA RTX 2000 series (and above) architecture with the most up-to-date drivers to get the best performance.

If you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. I also recommend taking a look at [the VulkanMod wiki](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/wiki).
