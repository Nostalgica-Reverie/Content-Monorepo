### Downloads

#### Stable builds

### Reporting Issues

If you do not need tech support and would like to report an issue (bug, crash, etc.) or otherwise request a feature for any version of Re-Console, then we encourage you to open an issue on the
[project issue tracker](https://codeberg.org/Nostalgica-Reverie/Legacy-Modpack-Monorepository/issues).

### Hardware Compatibility
Our modpacks, due to utilizing the powerful [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) mod, is only compatible with graphics cards that support ***OpenGL 4.5 or newer.***
Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years will meet these requirements, including the following:

-  INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer
-  NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer
-  AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer

If you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. I also recommend taking a look at [this page](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) on the Sodium wiki.
