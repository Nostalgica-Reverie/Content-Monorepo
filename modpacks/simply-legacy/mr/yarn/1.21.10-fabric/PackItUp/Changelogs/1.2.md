# Simply Legacy 1.2
## Summary
This update is mainly for parity with the first Re-Console+ beta release, primarily with the addition of experimental limited world generation

## 🟢 Additions
### Added Legacy World Sizes
This mod reintroduces Legacy Console Edition limited worlds. This change could introduce Mod Compatibility issues, so please be careful

## ⚪️ Configuration Changes
### Reset all Resource Albums and Global Resource Packs
Due to the file name change for Legacy Modpack Resources (`rcr3.zip -> legacymodpackresources.zip`) all Resource Albums (Texture Packs) and Global Resource Packs will be reset. This should *hopefully* be the last time, but no guarantees

## 🔵 Updates
### Updated all mods
All mods and resource packs in the modpack have been updated.

### Updated to Legacy Modpack Resources v4
This update comes with a lot of changes, integration with a lot of resource packs, and a bunch of work on some minor textures. As mentioned above, the file name change for this requires that resource packs be reset to preserve functionality.

## 🟣 Meta-changes
Re-Console, Simply Legacy and Rekindled Legacy have moved from GitHub to Codeberg for a variety of reasons. If you have an issue please preferably make one on the Codeberg repository. The GitHub repository is no longer actively maintained.

### New Changelog Format
To improve readability, the changelog format had been modified to allow for categories.
