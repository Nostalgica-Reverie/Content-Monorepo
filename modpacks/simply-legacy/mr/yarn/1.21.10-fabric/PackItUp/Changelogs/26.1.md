# Simply Legacy 26.1
### Adopted CalVer over SemVer for versioning
Both Re-Console+ and Simply Legacy we have also switched to CalVer (https://calver.org/)
- This means that the versioning scheme will be `YY.MAJOR.MINOR` instead of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where `MAJOR` was just `1` previously.
- `MAJOR.MINOR` will reset every year, and the `YY` will also increase to reflect the current year.
- Fancy version names have changed from `Simply Legacy 1.5.3 for Fabric 1.2.10` to just `Simply Legacy 26.1`

### Removed Krypton and Updated e4mc
We have now opted to remove Krypton to fix the e4mc issue, rather than holding back e4mc, as much of the optimizations came from the FNP Patcher anyways.

### Changed default Inventory and Crafting/Creative keybinds
The keybinds are now `E` and `R` respectively, rather than the previous `I` and `E`. This should improve reachability of these common functions.

### Set music frequency to FREQUENT
Self-explanatory; makes music more frequent than by default, but isn't too constant
