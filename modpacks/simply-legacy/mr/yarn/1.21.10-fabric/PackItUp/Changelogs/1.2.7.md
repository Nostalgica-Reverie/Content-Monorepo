# Simply Legacy 1.2.7
### Updated Minimega
This update adds the speedometer to Glide, as well as the ability to restart from the beginning or from a checkpoint.

### Updated Legacy Modpack Resources to 5.1.1                            
This comes with changes to the intro sequence, with slightly shorter slide durations and crossfading, as well as a "Loading..." screen

### Changed Resource Album handling
Now, mainly to ensure texture packs always work when updating from any version, built-in albums will be reset to their default pack order every update. This won't affect albums you've added outside of these.
