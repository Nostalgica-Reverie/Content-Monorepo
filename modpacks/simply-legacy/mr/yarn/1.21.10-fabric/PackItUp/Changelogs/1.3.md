# Simply Legacy 1.3
_Because we've likely had enough of 1.2_

### Removed Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (C2ME)
Due to some huge performance degradations on lower-end hardware, and my lack of config knowledge (lol), C2ME has been removed, either indefinitely or until we can come up with a more FPS-friendly config.
The 64 chunk maximum render distance is now handled by Bobby.
The existing configs will remain available so you can install C2ME yourself without having to manually disable all the save-breaking stuff.

### Updated the Super Mario Mash-up
@chilly has finally updated her port of the Super Mario Mash-Up Pack! That means the pack should now be playable on 1.21.10, and therefore on Simply Legacy (and soon Re-Console+, pending its update).
Bonus: Also adds features from The Copper Age

### Updated all mods
All mods (excluding e4mc, including LazyAI) have been updated.
**Updated Minimega**: New Fistfight features, internal leaderboard changes, and e4mc is now used for hosting matches.
