# Simply Legacy 1.2.2
### Added Legacy Nether: Extended
This mod adds a couple of extra features to the Nether dimension to match the behaviors of Console Edition. Also used to supplement Legacy World Sizes

### Added Intro Sequence resource pack
This is only here to properly organize the intro slides to pertain to the pack.

### Fixed Default options preset
Mainly since it was showing as `(Not Applied)` by default and would prompt if exiting the Graphics options for the first time.
