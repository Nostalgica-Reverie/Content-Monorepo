# Simply Legacy 1.2.5
### Updated Legacy Modpack Resources
Most notably, we have added 3 new presets!

**Added Very Low preset**
This is vaguely based on a what-if concept, of where LCE was ported to the 6th generation of consoles (like the ps2, and xbox!). It features a 4 render distance, fast graphics and smooth lighting disabled.
**Added Default+ preset**
Exactly the same as Default, but with a slightly higher render distance of 15, in-between Default and Medium presets' render distance.
**Added Extreme preset**
A preset for the beefiest of computers, running an absolutely massive 64 render distance!

**Added more How to Play screens**
HTP screens for Copper Tools, the Pale Garden and Trial Chambers have been added. The What's New section has also been updated to reflect the current game version.
