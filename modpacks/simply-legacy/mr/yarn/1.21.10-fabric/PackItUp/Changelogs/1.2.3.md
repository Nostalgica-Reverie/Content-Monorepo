# Simply Legacy 1.2.3
### Switched C2ME Autosave mode to VANILLA
This should hopefully fix a potential world corruption issue when exiting a world without saving and loading a previous autosave. It's uncommon enough that recreating the bug has been difficult, so if you're still experiencing world corruption at all, don't hesitate to report it on our Codeberg repository, or on Discord.
