# Simply Legacy 1.4
### Added initial CurseForge Support
As of writing, Simply Legacy is under review on CurseForge!
Due to some projects having complications with being published on CF, there are a few notable content gaps:
- Minimega (console minigames) is not available
- Legacy World Sizes is not available
- Pirates of the Caribbean, Fallout, Mass Effect and Super Mario Mash-up Packs are not available

### Added Tooltips Enhanced
Backports some new control icon stuff from Legacy4J upstream, courtesy of myself and NicSonic-_-

### Replaced AsyncParticles with Particle Core
Since Particle Core has been updated to 1.21.10, AsyncParticles has been deprecated in favor of it.

### Updated Intro Sequence
The "Loading..." slides now have an image reminiscent of the disc loading screen seen on Xbox 360 Edition

### Adjusted and abbreviated some config files
This was done to match the upcoming Simply Optimized Forked

### Updated all mods
All mods and resource packs have been updated.
