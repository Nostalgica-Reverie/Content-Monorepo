# Simply Legacy 1.2.8
### Added Simply Legacy Resources
With the help of Simple Resource Loader, resources that are required for the base experience, including language files, Texture Pack comparison and icon images, and intro sequence modifications, are now force applied.

### Updated C2ME config
This should yield better chunk loading performance.

### Fixed Cubes Without Borders default config
Now the CWB config will be generated by the mod, rather than using a pre-generated config. Those with this issue who are updating should delete their `config/cubes-without-borders.json` and let it regenerate. If this persists, let me know.

### Updated all mods
All mods and resource packs have been updated.
