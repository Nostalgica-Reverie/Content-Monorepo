Unfinished as of now, but is finished up to ~1.15.x, with some 1.16.x content too. More to come later!

This feature was actually initially added in 0.8.0! It re-adds in Bedrock/LCE like placing, and was an unlogged change if i remember correctly. It was removed when we ported to 1.21.4, but has been reintroduced across all versions.

Now all versions have their own specific panoramas!



\### Added Preferred Gamerules

For usage later, could be configured by the users

Speeds up loading on 1.21.1 NeoForge!

Could improve performance significantly, specially because it modifies UI.

ServerCore could improve performance meaningfully in singleplayer; so it has been added!

Primarily; it deduplicates liquid ticks, improves world gen speed and may come with a side effect of minor vanilla parity breakage. 



\### Added Ixeris

Should improve performance marginally. Thanks to \[chorb](https://www.curseforge.com/members/chorb/projects>) for telling me about the mod.

Improvement to particle performance, could be useful for mob farms, or wandering around on 1.21.5+
