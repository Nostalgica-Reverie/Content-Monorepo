It introduces long-standing GUI issues, in-game issues, performance problems and a lot more. If you would like to play multiplayer for free, open to LAN and you will recieve a link you can use for your friends to play with you! We also object heavily to Essentials usage of in-game microtransactions, in an otherwise completely free and open source modding community.",
