# Re-Console+ 0.1-alpha.2.0

# Summary
This update introduces some new texture packs, presets, and fixes some issues.

## 🟢 Additions

## Added New Presets
These are most notable, as we have added 3 new presets!

### Added Very Low preset
This is vaguely based on a what-if concept, of where LCE was ported to the 6th generation of consoles (like the ps2, and xbox!). It features a 4 render distance and fast graphics

### Added Default Plus preset
Exactly the same as Default, but with a slightly higher render distance of 15

### Added Maximum preset
A preset for the beefiest of computers, running an absolutely massive 64 render distance!

## Added New Texture Packs
There are a few making a return and some new ones too!

### Added Dark Mode Texture Pack
Ease your eyes with the dark mode texture pack!

### Added Vanilla Plus Texture Pack
3D rails, 3D doors.. and more!

### Re-introduced PS4 Parity texture pack
Originally a feature in 0.8.0, which was removed a while back.

## Added Zoomify
Replaces Zume.

## Added TU0 GUI to the Beta and Alpha Texture Packs
This is a port of the gui used in Rekindled Legacy.
- This may cause bugs, and does not support SD mode
    - These may not be 100% accurate.

## Added more How To Play screens
We have finished a few more how to plays. Thanks to @nicsonic for the Trial Chamber one!
- These are still not done.
    - They will continue to be worked on

## ⚪️ Configuration Changes

### Fixed a crash with Animatium
The mod had a broken config option that has now been fixed.

### Fixed a rare world-corrupting issue in the c2^ME config
A rare issue could occur, with auto-save to where the c2^ME enhanced autosave could cause a double-save. This would cause world corruption and has now been fixed

## Blacklisted more mods
More mods have been added to the blocklist. This was initially just essential, but some culprits that continually cause issues have been blocked now.

This list is:
- Not Enough Crashes
- Embeddium
- Zume 
- No Chat Reports
- Legacy Mipmaps
- Noisium 
- Faster Random

# 🟣 Meta-changes
As due to our switch to Dexrn’s PackItUp software, we have temporarily lost the ability to publish to CurseForge. 

This should be fixed ASAP! Until then we will work on polishing the CF release of RC+, to hopefully release it in a good state.
