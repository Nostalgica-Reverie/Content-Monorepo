# Re-Console+ 0.1-alpha.2.301

# Summary
This update primarily changes resource albums. It separates lang file changes into a force-enabled resource pack, which means that LMR can now be below the mash up ports, allowing their panoramas to show.

## 🟢 Additions

## Added Legacy Panorama
Ported from Simply Legacy and applied to the Classic and PS4 Parity texture packs.

## Added Re-Console+ Language Files 
These are that make important changes to lang. This is always on, and cannot be turned off.

## Added TU0 Panorama into the TU0 GUI resource pack
Applies to the Alpha and Beta album, for accuracy.

## ⚪️ Configuration Changes

### Improved the c2^ME config
This should help mitigate minor stuttering issues.

## 🟤 Performance

### Added Culler
Can improve performance in some situations.

### Added Player Culling
Culls players through walls, improving performance on multiplayer

## 🔴 Removals

### Removed MoreCulling
Causes issues with Minimega.

### Temporarily Removed Animatium
Causes issues connecting in multiplayer

# 🟣 Meta-changes

### Update on CurseForge
CurseForge is now actively receiving some significant improvements! Many new resource packs initially only on Modrinth. I am hoping to achieve RC+ on CF by about Alpha 3.0, as our tooling needs to catch up still.

Currently the improvements are the implementation of skin packs, a bunch of mash ups, the implementation of custom resource packs, etc, etc
