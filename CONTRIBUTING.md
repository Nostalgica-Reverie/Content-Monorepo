## Contributing Guidelines

The Content Monorepo has some guidelines and suggestions to keep the commits of the 30+ projects hosted here trackable.

### Commit Tagging
Please adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) handbook for writing your commits. Please also tag your commits according to the project, ie, if you are fixing an issue on Re-Console, do fix(re-console), or fix(rc):.
