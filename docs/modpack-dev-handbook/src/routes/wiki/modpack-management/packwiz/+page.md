# packwiz

packwiz is a command line tool for creating Minecraft modpacks. Instead of managing JAR files directly, packwiz creates TOML metadata files which can be easily version-controlled and shared with git (see an example pack [here](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-example-pack)). You can then [export it to a CurseForge or Modrinth modpack](/wiki/modpack-management/packwiz/tutorials/hosting/curseforge), or [use packwiz-installer](/wiki/modpack-management/packwiz/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer) for an auto-updating MultiMC instance.

packwiz is great for...

- Distributing private modpacks for servers
- Creating modpacks for CurseForge and Modrinth

packwiz is not so great for...

- Managing downloaded mod files (use [Curse/GDLauncher or another CLI](https://gist.github.com/comp500/13ae6f058221196077fb19953ac608c7))
- People who want a GUI (though there are some [third-party efforts](https://github.com/ExoPlant/packwiz-gui))
