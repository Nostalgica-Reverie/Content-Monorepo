      --meta-folder string        The folder in which new metadata files will be added, defaulting to a folder based on the category (mods, resourcepacks, etc; if the category is unknown the current directory is used)
      --meta-folder-base string   The base folder from which meta-folder will be resolved, defaulting to the current directory (so you can put all mods/etc in a subfolder while still using the default behaviour) (default ".")
      --no-refresh                Skip index and pack.toml refresh after modifications (use 'packwand refresh' to finalize batch operations)
