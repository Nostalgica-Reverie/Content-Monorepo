The biome's fog is a dull lilac color, and ambient ash particles float through the air. Archipelagos with islands of different sizes can be found around the lava seas nearby. On the ceiling, glowstone blobs generate as usual. Both brown and red mushrooms still grow in this biome on top of the basalt blocks. Nether fortresses and ruined portals can be found here. Nether quartz ore, Nether gold ore, and the rare ancient debris generate underground, but are more difficult to obtain due to the abundance of deltas and lava seas. Ore also spawns more frequently to compensate for the significantly reduced amount of netherrack in the biome. Bastion remnants are not present, making basalt deltas the only Nether biome to not feature them. Magma cubes have a higher spawn rate in this biome than in any other biome.
